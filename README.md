# Personal Shell Dotfiles

Hi, welcome to my collection of dotfiles!  My interactive shell of choice is
zsh for the better tab cycling and other QOL features.  I used to use Oh-My-Zsh
to get started with zsh in general(I recommend you do this), but once I got the
hang of zsh, I wanted to use vanilla zsh and configured my zsh to have most of
the features of Oh-My-Zsh I wanted.  

My editor of choice is vim, as it's quick and is built to edit files quickly and
painlessly.  My vim is configured to be fast (i.e. disabling Syntastic until I
call it), and most plugins have been timed to ensure they do not drag the load
time.  Some notable plugins include NerdTree, airline, Syntastic, vim-commenter,
and ctags. 

I used tmux along with my vim to simulate an IDE.  Notably, vim splits and tmux
splits can be navigated seamlessly, as I use both on a daily basis.
Additionally, my tmux can restore sessions after I turn off my computer, letting
me pick up where I was previously.  

My git files are sourced as well, essentially providing some common aliases and
shortcuts for using git.  Also ignores files that have no reason to be part of a
project.

Feel free to use my dotfiles, although beware these are configred for a Mac
(terminal color output may be different, for example, on windows).  If you like
it, drop a star!
